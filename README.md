# LDR-Based-Light-Switching-System
# Project Objective:
To design a light control system that automatically turns on a street light (or any light source) when it becomes dark and turns it off when there is sufficient daylight, using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and basic electronic components.
# Working Principle:
The system is based on the light-sensing capability of an LDR. An LDR changes its resistance based on the intensity of light falling on it:

Bright light = low resistance

Darkness = high resistance

This change in resistance alters the voltage in a voltage divider circuit, which is used to switch a transistor. The transistor acts as an electronic switch to turn a relay or LED on or off.
# What the Basic PBC Circuit Includes:

LDR as light sensor

LED/light bulb

Resistors 

Power supply (Battery)

Switch 

# Applications:

Street lighting automation
